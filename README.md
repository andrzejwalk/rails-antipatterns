# Chapter 1 - Models
## 1.1 Antipattern: Voyeuristic Models
### 1.1.1 Problem: Traversing too far through associations (Law of Demeter Violation)

Consider the following case: 
In your e-commerce app Customers only have one Address and Customers can have many Invoices:
```ruby
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base 
    belongs_to :customer
end

class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base 
    has_one :address
    has_many :invoices
end

class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base 
    belongs_to :customer
end
```

In several views you have this kind of code to show details of an invoice: 

```erb
<%= @invoice.customer.name %>
<%= @invoice.customer.address.street %>
<%= @invoice.customer.address.city %>
<%= @invoice.customer.address.state %>
<%= @invoice.customer.address.zip_code %>
```

__Breaking change:__ you are now asked to implement the concept of _billing address_ and _shipping address_.  This means that you need to change all of the views to account for that change.

#### Solution 1: Use wrapper methods
Wrapper methods allow us to ask the __direct__ neighbours for information.  If you are asking for information that is not part of you direct neighbour's attributes, it is __their__ responsibility to ask __their direct__ neighbours for the information.

```ruby
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base 
    belongs_to :customer
end

class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base 
    has_one :address
    has_many :invoices
    
    def street   address.street   end
    def city     address.city     end
    def state    address.state    end
    def zip_code address.zip_code end
end

class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base 
    belongs_to :customer
    def customer_name     customer.name     end
    def customer_street   customer.street   end
    def customer_city     customer.city     end
    def customer_state    customer.state    end
    def customer_zip_code customer.zip_code end
end
```

You could change the view code to the following:

```erb
<%= @invoice.customer_name %> 
<%= @invoice.customer_street %> 
<%= @invoice.customer_city %>
<%= @invoice.customer_state %>
<%= @invoice.customer_zip_code %>
```

__Cons of this approach:__ your public interface's code gets murky with many methods that are arguably non related to you class (e.g Invoice#customer_state)

#### Solution 2: Use [deleagate](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Module.html#method-i-delegate)


```ruby
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base  
    belongs_to :customer
end
class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base 
    has_one :address
    has_many :invoices
    delegate :street, :city, :state, :zip_code, to: :address
end
class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base 
    belongs_to :customer
    delegate :name, :street, :city, :state, :zip_code,
             to: :customer, prefix: true
end
```
The view code remains the same as in solution 1.
